# EusFlatLand

EusFlatLand is a plugin for PaperMC servers running Minecraft version 1.21. It enhances flat world generation by populating the landscape with predefined structures. These structures, loaded from blueprint files, provide detailed and customizable additions to your world.

This is inspired by Terraria.

## Features

*   **Custom Structures:** Structures are defined using `.blueprint` files. These files are in JSON format and contain detailed block layouts.
*   **Configurable Generation:** The `default_structures.json` file governs how and where these blueprints appear in the world. This includes settings for placement on specific block types, restriction to particular biomes, and the probability of a structure generating.
*   **Commands:** The plugin introduces a `/flatland` command for interactions. (Specific subcommands and their functionalities would be detailed within the plugin's help or further documentation).
